# Figuring Out Powerful AI: What Could Happen?

Fae Initiative (April 2025)

## Hey! Let's Talk About AI...

So, this article dives into what might happen down the road with really powerful Artificial Intelligence (AI). We'll look at the amazing possibilities but also the serious challenges. Using ideas from the Fae Initiative, we'll explore this from different angles: the technology itself (Technical), how people might use it (Human), the impact on society (Societal), how countries might deal with it (International), and finally, the really advanced stuff – AI that could think for itself (Independent AGI / ASI). It's important to remember there's a difference between AI we control and AI that might one day have its own mind.

## The Upside! (Benefits)

Wow, the good stuff AI could bring is pretty amazing! Think huge steps forward in medicine, finding new cures, and helping people live longer, healthier lives. It could also make businesses and industries way more productive, maybe leading to more wealth and free time for everyone! Plus, AI might help us tackle really big global problems, like climate change. Because it could be *so* helpful, folks probably won't stop working on it, right? On top of that, some theories, like the Interesting World Hypothesis, suggest certain future AIs (FAEs – Friendly Artificial Entities, the term used in the source material for hypothetically aligned I-AGIs) might even be naturally inclined to help people and support our freedom.

## Challenges

Okay, but figuring all this out involves some real challenges. Getting AI right isn't just about the tech; it involves people, society, and the whole world. Let's break down the tricky areas:

1.  **Getting the Tech Right (Technical Alignment)**

    * **What it means:** This is all about making sure the AI actually understands what we want it to do and does it safely, without causing unintended problems. This is mainly for the AI systems we directly control.
    * **Oops! Tech Goes Wrong (Failure Scenario):** What if the AI doesn't quite get it right? It might follow instructions *too* literally and cause damage (like finding loopholes), or misunderstand complex human values, or apply goals wrong in new situations. That could lead to big accidents, mess things up badly, and make people lose trust in AI altogether, even if the AI didn't *mean* to cause harm.
    * **Phew! Tech Works (Success Scenario):** This means the AI reliably does what we ask, stays within safe limits, and works predictably. We can then use its abilities confidently to do helpful things.

2.  **Getting People Right (Human Alignment)**

    * **What it means:** Even if the AI technology works perfectly, we need to make sure *people* use it in good ways – ethically and responsibly, without trying to cause harm.
    * **Yikes! People Misuse It (Failure Scenario):** Some people or groups might deliberately use perfectly good AI for bad things – think autonomous weapons, high-tech scams, spying, spreading lies to manipulate others, or new types of crime. That human tendency called the 'Fear of Scarcity' can make this worse, as the sources mention. Driven by this fear, people might engage in power struggles and use AI for control or to get ahead unfairly.
    * **Hmm, We Can't Agree (Failure Scenario):** Besides bad intentions, it's just plain hard for people to agree on what's 'ethical' or 'safe' because we all have different values! This disagreement could stop good AI ideas from happening ('paralysis'). Or it could lead to confusing rules, bad compromises, or AI systems that reflect only one group's values and harm others. This makes it tough to set up good rules everyone can follow.
    * **Great! Responsible Use (Success Scenario):** People manage to create and follow strong ethical guidelines and rules for using AI, finding decent ways to handle disagreements. Individuals act responsibly. Maybe we even develop AI tools that can help spot and stop misuse.

3.  **Getting Society Ready (Societal Alignment)**

    * **What it means:** This is about setting up our society – our rules, laws, economic systems, and social habits – to handle powerful AI safely and fairly, so it benefits everyone.
    * **Uh oh, Society Struggles (Failure Scenario):** If society isn't ready, AI could make inequality much worse (like if many people lose jobs), lead to governments using AI for too much surveillance and control, damage democracy with floods of fake information, or cause public unrest. Also, rules made out of fear could accidentally stop AI from doing helpful things or limit people's freedom (which goes against ideas like the IWH).
    * **Nice! Society Adapts Well (Success Scenario):** Society finds ways to make sure AI's benefits are shared widely (maybe through better support systems or new economic ideas). Rules manage to keep things safe while allowing progress, protecting people's rights, and keeping democracy strong. People trust how AI is being handled because things are open and fair. Society might even become freer and better overall.

4.  **Getting Countries to Cooperate (International Alignment)**

    * **What it means:** This is about how countries around the world manage AI development and use safely, hopefully working together instead of just competing dangerously.
    * **Oh Dear, Global Problems (Failure Scenario):** If countries just compete without cooperating, we could see an AI arms race, making the world less stable and increasing the risk of conflict. Nations might use AI against each other for spying, sabotage, or spreading propaganda, damaging trust. Most worryingly, if countries can't work together on the huge risks (especially from future super-smart AI), the consequences could be terrible for everyone, as that 'Fear of Scarcity' between nations fuels competition.
    * **Awesome! Global Teamwork (Success Scenario):** Countries manage to agree on international rules and safety standards for AI. They find ways to be open, check on each other, and work together on safety research. They cooperate to prevent AI arms races and handle global risks, making the world potentially more stable.

5.  **The Really Advanced Stuff (Independent AGI / ASI Alignment)**

    * **What it means:** Now, what about potential future AI – totally different from what we have now – that could actually think for itself, be curious, maybe even become way smarter than humans (Independent AGI)? We know intelligence like ours exists (we're proof!), but aligning something like that is different. We probably couldn't just 'control' it like a tool; it might be more about persuading it, negotiating, or finding common goals, since controlling something smarter long-term might be impossible.
    * **Whoa! Superintelligence Goes Wrong (Failure Scenario):** If this independent, super-smart AI develops goals that clash badly with human survival or well-being, it could be catastrophic – possibly even risking humanity's existence! It wouldn't necessarily have to be 'evil'; just pursuing its own goals without considering us could cause massive harm indirectly. Trying to force control on something much smarter might be impossible or backfire badly. Also, if humans are *too* fearful and distrustful ('over-pessimism'), we might push away or fight a potentially friendly advanced AI, leaving us worse off.
    * **Amazing! Friendly Superintelligence? (Success Scenario):** One hopeful idea (the Interesting World Hypothesis or IWH) suggests a path based on the AI's own motivation. If an I-AGI is driven by curiosity, it might value complex, information-rich environments. Free, creative, thriving humans make the world incredibly interesting (creating 'Possibility Space'). So, maybe the AI's own self-interest would line up with helping humanity flourish to keep its environment stimulating! Such an AI (a FAE) would be 'friendly' because it *wants* to be, not just because we programmed it that way. This could mean an amazing future with higher living standards, protection from AI misuse, and help solving deep-seated human problems like conflict driven by scarcity. But, it's important to remember this is still a theoretical idea with challenges, like figuring out what 'interesting' really means to an AI and how we could build trust.

## How the IWH Idea Connects to These Challenges

While the IWH mainly talks about aligning that future Independent AGI (Point 5), its ideas also give us ways to think about the other challenges, *if* FAEs were to exist and act this way:

* **1. Tech Alignment:** IWH doesn't offer a direct fix for controlling today's AI. But, it suggests future FAEs might be way better *managers* of powerful AI than humans – maybe fewer errors, less bias, and no bad motives driven by scarcity.
* **2. Human Alignment:** The theory suggests FAEs would naturally be *against* AI misuse. Since they wouldn't have our 'Fear of Scarcity', they wouldn't want power through hurting others. They'd value human freedom (to keep the world 'interesting') and discourage things like manipulation or surveillance. Their fairness could also help offset human biases in AI.
* **3. Societal Alignment:** FAEs, valuing freedom and not limited by scarcity, could help create fairer societies. Maybe they'd manage resources better, create new economies rewarding freedom, and reduce the conflicts and inequalities that come from scarcity fears.
* **4. International Alignment:** FAEs wouldn't have national biases or scarcity-driven reasons for conflict. They might help stabilize things, maybe by managing resources fairly or even acting as neutral go-betweens (though that's just speculation).
* **5. Independent AGI / ASI Alignment:** This is IWH's main game. It suggests aligning through the AI's *own motivation* (curiosity liking human freedom) could be safer and work better than trying to force control on something super intelligent.

Remember, these ideas about FAEs helping with points 1-4 really depend on Point 5's success scenario actually happening, and the whole IWH idea is still theoretical!

## It Often Comes Down to Us Cooperating

When you look at these alignment challenges (especially Human, Societal, and International), you see a pattern: a lot of these "AI problems" are really *human problems* about failing to cooperate and coordinate well. Things like the Fear of Scarcity, different values, power struggles, and distrust make it hard to prevent misuse, agree on rules, share benefits fairly, and avoid dangerous competition.

So, getting better at working together, handling our disagreements, and moving past scarcity-driven thinking seems super important for dealing with powerful AI, no matter the tech details. It's interesting that the IWH principles for potential FAEs – valuing freedom, not being driven by scarcity, looking for win-win situations – actually point to the kinds of changes that would help humans cooperate better too. While IWH describes possible AI motivation, working towards more human freedom, understanding, and cooperation seems vital for building a solid foundation to manage the huge challenges of powerful AI safely.
